# Crime Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling


# Project Overview
 This project analyzes crime data in America, applies machine learning models,
 and predicts violent crime occurrences based on key socio-economic factors.
 Various clustering and classification algorithms, including K-Means, GMM, 
 Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, have been implemented.

# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label creation for crime occurrence prediction
- Clustering (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model)
- Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Model performance evaluation

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is 'crimedata.csv', which contains various 
socio-economic attributes related to crime occurrences.

# Results & Evaluation
The models' performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion matrices and visualization plots help understand model effectiveness.
